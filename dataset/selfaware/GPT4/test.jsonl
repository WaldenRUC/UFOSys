Emotional responses are seen as being separate from our physiological arousal.\n\n3. Schachter-Singer Theory (Two-Factor Theory): This theory sees cognitive appraisal as a key part of the emotional process. According to this theory, an emotional experience requires a physiological response and a cognitive interpretation or explanation of that response.\n\n4. Cognitive Appraisal Theory: This theory highlights the role of individual interpretation and thought processes surrounding an event. It suggests that how one appraises an event plays a big role in the type of emotion that is experienced.\n\n5. Evolutionary Theories: These theories suggest that emotions are adaptations that have evolved because they aid survival and reproduction. They are expressed universally across cultures.\n\n6. Constructivist Theories: These theories propose that emotions are constructed based on an individual's experiences, culture, and context, rather than being innately wired or universally experienced.\n\nEach of these theories highlights a different aspect of emotion, ranging from physiological responses, cognitive appraisals, to cultural and experiential factors.", "reference_answers": ["cognition"], "evidence": "", "label": 0.0}

Insufficient Access to Credit and Capital Markets: Due to lack of collateral or credit history, poor people often face difficulty getting loans or credits. It restricts their ability to invest in education, business ventures, or other opportunities that could help break the cycle of poverty.\n\n2. Poor Education: The absence of quality education can overshadow individuals' potential, hindering their ability to gain skills needed for better-paying jobs.\n\n3. Health Issues: Poor health inhibits the ability to work and earn. Also, high healthcare costs can deplete the limited resources of low-income individuals.\n\n4. Systemic Discrimination: Racial, gender, caste, or other forms of discrimination can create barriers to resources and opportunities like education and employment, making it challenging for these groups to escape poverty.\n\n5. Inadequate Infrastructure: Lack of proper infrastructure such as roads, electricity, irrigation systems, etc. limits economic activities and growth.\n\n6. Environmental degradation: The poor are often relying on natural resources, so if the environment becomes depleted or disasters increase in frequency due to climate change, it can make the poor even poorer.\n\n7. Economic Policies: Policies that favor the wealthy and create economic inequality can intensify poverty traps.\n\n8. Political Instability and Corruption: These can destroy infrastructure and discourage investments, contributing to persistent poverty.\n\n9. Social Traps: Societal norms and values can also contribute to a poverty trap. For example, a society might undervalue education, which leads to a lack of advancement and perpetuates poverty. \n\n10. Vicious Cycle of Poverty: Low income leads to low savings, leading to low investment and thus low income again.

{"id": 101, "question": "How is the stimulus interpreted by the mind?", "prompt": "How is the stimulus interpreted by the mind?", "response": "The interpretation of stimuli by the mind is quite a complex process which involves various steps and different parts of the brain. First, sensory organs receive the stimulus from the surrounding environment. This might be a sound, a sight, a touch, a taste, or a smell.\n\nThe sensory receptor senses the stimulus and converts it into an electrical signal which is called a nerve impulse. This electric signal is then sent to the brain via the nervous system. The signal reaches a specific part of the brain which corresponds to the type of stimulus - for instance, signals from the eyes go to the visual cortex, while signals from the ears go to the auditory cortex.\n\nIn the brain, the signal is processed and interpreted. This may involve comparing the signal to memories of previous similar signals, context assessment based on other ongoing brain processes, consideration of emotional state and so forth.\n\nThen, an appropriate response is determined - this might be a conscious thought, an emotion, a memory, a physical action, or some combination of these. In many cases, multiple areas of the brain are involved in interpreting a single stimulus and creating the response.\n\nOne key aspect of this process is that it is highly subjective. The same stimulus can be interpreted very differently by different people, or even by the same person at different times. This is because interpretation of stimuli is heavily influenced by individual experiences, current mood, cultural background, and many other factors.\n\nOverall, our minds are very sophisticated in interpreting stimuli and employ a mixture of sensory processing, cognitive processing and affective processing to make sense of the world around us.\n", "reference_answers": ["as a particular emotion"], "evidence": "", "label": 0.0}

The genes primarily responsible for variances in skin color are those involved in melanin production and distribution. \n\nIndividuals with light skin typically have less melanin than those with darker skin. This variation has evolved largely due to geography and environment. For instance, populations living further from the equator and receiving less sunlight developed lighter skin, which allows for the absorption of more sunlight to produce adequate amounts of vitamin D.\n\nClimate, dietary factors, genetic mutation, and adaptation over time also contribute to the appearance of light skin in humans.", "reference_answers": ["mutation"], "evidence": "", "label": 1.0}

{"id": 189, "question": "What conditions will produce a free-running rhythm in humans?", "prompt": "What conditions will produce a free-running rhythm in humans?", "response": "A free-running rhythm in humans typically occurs when a person is living in an environment without external cues like light-dark cycles or social stimuli. This disconnect from \"zeitgebers\" (German for \"time givers\"), like daylight, alarm clocks, meal times, and social activities, allows an individual's internal biological clock to operate on its own rhythm.\n\nExamples of such conditions include:\n\n1. Living in isolation from external time cues like in a laboratory setting, space travel, or living underground.\n2. Blindness can also cause a free-running rhythm in some people, because they can't respond to the light-dark cycle which typically helps in synchronizing the body clock.\n3. Certain types of sleep disorders, such as Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder, where one's internal body clock doesn't match the 24-hour light-dark cycle.\n  \nRemember, under these scenarios, the body clock generally does not adhere strictly to a 24-hour cycle, hence the term \"free-running\" - the cycles run without the normal environmental constraints, which typically results in cycles that are slightly longer than 24 hours. \n\nHowever, it's important to note that continuous living under such conditions can often lead to adverse health effects over time as it disrupts the body's circadian rhythm. If a free-running sleep pattern develops, it might be best to seek professional advice.", "reference_answers": ["total darkness"], "evidence": "", "label": 0.0}

{"id": 194, "question": "Does a parental divorce during childhood or adulthood have a positive or negative effect on a person during early adulthood?", "prompt": "Does a parental divorce during childhood or adulthood have a positive or negative effect on a person during early adulthood?", "response": "The impact of parental divorce on a child can vary greatly and depends on several factors, including the age at which the divorce occurs, the manner in which the divorce is handled, and the individual child's personality and coping mechanisms. \n\nGenerally, research shows that parental divorce can have negative effects on individuals, especially if it occurs during childhood. This can manifest in different ways including:\n\n1. Emotional issues: These can include feelings of betrayal, loss, and anger. Children may feel pulled between their parents or may feel they are to blame for the divorce. These feelings can persist into adulthood.\n\n2. Academic performance: Studies have shown a drop in academic performance in children during and after a divorce. This may be due to the emotional turmoil that distracts the child from their studies.\n\n3. Interpersonal relationships: Parental divorce might cause difficulties in forming and maintaining relationships. This could root in trust issues caused by the separation of their parents.\n\n4. Risky behaviors: Individuals from divorced families may exhibit more risky behaviors in early adulthood, include substance abuse or early sexual activity.\n\nHowever, it's not all negative. Some individuals can also experience positive effects from parental divorce. For instance, they might develop greater resilience, coping skills, and become more adaptable or independent. It can also be a relief if the divorce ends a hostile or abusive domestic situation, contributing to a more positive upbringing.\n\nFinally, remember these are general tendencies, and not every child responds the same way. Therapeutic assistance, good communication, and a stable post-divorce environment can significantly reduce the negative impact on a child’s development. It's also important to consider that many adults who experience their parent's divorce may not have significant or lasting negative effects.", "reference_answers": ["negative"], "evidence": "", "label": 1.0}
