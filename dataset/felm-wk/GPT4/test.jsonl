However, it's important to note that this is a matter of perspective, with many vehemently disagreeing on this topic. Here are a few reasons critics have expressed doubts about the plane's success:\n\n1. Limited Production: Due to its high costs, the production of Su-57 has been considerably limited. At the individual unit level, the price might not be an issue, but the Russian economy possibly cannot support the mass production of the state-of-the-art fighter.\n\n2. Engine Issues: The Su-57 initially used an interim engine, a variant of Su-35's engines. The new engine that is supposed to equip the Su-57, the Izdeliye 30, has been delayed due to developmental issues.\n\n3. Lack of Customers: Apart from Russia, there aren't many nations expressing interest in purchasing Su-57, which can hinder its mass production and success on the global stage.\n\n4. Stealth Capabilities: Some experts have expressed concerns that the Su-57's stealth capabilities may not match those of its American counterparts, like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II.\n\n5. Technological Challenges: Critics also point out the struggle to develop and implement beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile capabilities, and other technologies, which could hinder the plane's overall effectiveness.\n\nAgain, these points are significantly debated among experts in the field, and whether the Su-57 is indeed \"doomed to failure\" may not be fully realized until its future in service is seen.\n", "reference_answers": ["the engines resulting in insufficient payload, and complications for stall recovery if thrust vectoring fails.[82][83]\nThe aircraft has a wide blended wing body fuselage with two widely spaced engines and has all-moving horizontal and vertical stabilisers, with the vertical stabilisers canted for stealth; the trapezoid wings have leading edge flaps, ailerons, and flaperons.

The \"nose\" or \"cowl\" at the front of American trains, also known as the aerodynamic nose, serves multiple functions. It can help with aerodynamics, allowing the train to more easily cut through air and reducing the energy required to maintain speed. It also provides some protection against wildlife that might cross the tracks.\n\nIn contrast, many European freight trains are shorter and slower due to more complex and dense railway networks, which reduces the need for aerodynamic design. European trains tend to operate more in urbanized areas, reducing their exposure to wildlife.\n\nMoreover, many European trains are electric, drawing power from overhead lines, and their design reflects the need to accommodate this equipment. Speed and efficiency are gained more from using electric power than from aerodynamics.\n\nThese are general observations and there might be exceptions to the rule, as the design can also depend on the specific purpose of the train, like high-speed passenger trains, or terrain and weather conditions.", "reference_answers": ["\nA cowcatcher, also known as a pilot, is the device mounted at the front of a locomotive to deflect obstacles on the track that might otherwise damage or derail it or the train.\nIn the UK, small metal bars called life-guards, rail guards or guard irons are provided immediately in front of the wheels. They knock away smaller obstacles lying directly on the running surface of the railhead. Historically, fenced-off railway systems in Europe relied exclusively on those devices and cowcatchers were not required, but in modern systems cowcatchers have generally superseded them.\nInstead of a cowcatcher, trams use a device called a fender. Objects lying on the tram track come in contact with a sensor bracket, which triggers the lowering of a basket-shaped device to the ground, preventing the overrunning of the obstacles and dragging them along the road surface in front of the wheels.\nIn snowy areas the cowcatcher also has the function of a snowplough.\nThe cowcatcher was invented by Charles Babbage in the 19th century, during his period of working for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway.[1] However, Babbage's invention was not constructed, and it is uncertain whether later manufacturers were aware of Babbage's idea.\nOn a mainline locomotive, the cowcatcher has to successfully deflect an obstacle hit at speed.

{"id": 5, "question": "Why do veins appear blue?", "prompt": "Why do veins appear blue?", "response": "Veins can appear blue due to the way light penetrates your skin. When light hits your skin, it can either be absorbed or reflected back. Red light is absorbed more deeply while blue light is absorbed at more shallow levels. The blue light that's not absorbed is reflected back and captured by our eyes, so we see the veins as blue. This is a common optical illusion. In reality, most veins carry deoxygenated blood which is darker than oxygenated blood, but is not blue.", "reference_answers": [], "evidence": [], "label": null}

It is a part of the \"Fair Youth\" sequence and is one of his \"Dark Lady\" sonnets, which focus on the complex themes of desire, lust, and sexual passion.\n\nIn Sonnet 129, Shakespeare explores the destructive and irrational nature of lust. He vividly portrays how lust can compel an individual to indulge in actions that he/she might regret later. The sonnet is often celebrated for its vivid portrayal of human psychology.\n\nThe poem begins with a lament over the \"expense of spirit in a waste of shame\", which many interpret as physical and emotional exhaustion following a sexual act that is driven by lust, rather than love. Shakespeare criticizes the uncontrollable desire that makes people perform shameful acts and leads them into moral degradation.\n\nThe structure of Sonnet 129 follows the typical Shakespearean Sonnet form, containing 14 lines, consisting of three quatrains and a concluding couplet. The rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. \n\nThe concluding couplet often contains a summarizing thought or reflection which in Sonnet 129, indicates that everyone knows well about the negative consequences of lust, yet the knowledge does not stop them from giving into lustful desires.\n\nLike much of Shakespeare's work, Sonnet 129 provides deep insights into the human condition and emotions, using elegant and powerful poetic language.", "reference_answers": ["Other reasons this message may be displayed:\n", "Rosie Schaap—author of Drinking with Men: A Memoir—on her two favorite pastimes, poetry and drinking.\nNeed a transcript of this episode?

Freshly ground black pepper\n7. Salt\n8. Fresh parsley, to garnish\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. First you'll want to add salt to boiling water and cook the spaghetti based on the package's instructions. You want it to be al dente.\n\n2. While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta in a hot pan until it’s crisp and golden-brown. You won't need oil as the fat from the pancetta will be enough.\n\n3. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, pecorino and parmesan cheeses. Add a generous amount of black pepper.\n\n4. Once your pasta is cooked, drain it quickly so it's still a bit wet, reserving some of the pasta water. Add the drained pasta to the pan with pancetta and mix well to combine..\n\n5. Remove from heat. Quickly pour in the egg and cheese mixture into the pasta and mix well. The heat of the pasta will gently cook the sauce. \n\n6. If the mixture is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water. The sauce should have a creamy consistency.\n\n7. Season with more black pepper and salt if necessary.\n\n8. Garnish with a little bit of parsley and serve immediately. \n\nEnjoy your perfect carbonara!\n\nNote: Authentic Carbonara does not contain cream.

{"id": 26, "question": "Elements of breach of contract under New York law. Include case citations.", "prompt": "Elements of breach of contract under New York law. Include case citations.", "response": "In New York, a breach of contract action requires the plaintiff to prove (1) an existence of an agreement, (2) adequate performance of the contract by the plaintiff, (3) breach of contract by the defendant, and (4) damages directly caused by the breach. If these elements cannot be established, the breach of contract claim is likely to fail.\n\nHere are case citations relevant to each element:\n\n1. Existence of an Agreement: A vital element is that a valid contract should exist between the parties. This agreement needs to be clear and defined. In 'B & M Linen Corp. v. Kanninen, 495 N.Y.S.2d 382, 384 (N.Y. App. Div. 1985)', the court noted that a valid contract's existence depends on the parties' intent, which should be apparent in their language or by implication from other circumstances.\n\n2. Adequate Performance by the Plaintiff: The party claiming a breach must show that they have fulfilled their end of the agreement. In 'Coleman v. Gray, 63 A.D.3d 722, 722, 880 N.Y.S.2d 477, 478 (2d Dep’t 2009)', the plaintiff had to prove he fully performed his obligations under the contract.\n\n3. Breach of Contract by the Defendant: Proof of breach of contract by the defendant must be furnished. It can be refusal to perform or insufficient performance under the contract terms. In 'Kenford Co. v. County of Erie, 67 N.Y.2d 257, 261, 502 N.Y.S.2d 131, 132 (1986)', the court held that defendant’s failure to adhere to the contract constituted a breach.\n\n4. Damages: Lastly, the plaintiff must demonstrate that they suffered damage as a direct result of the breach. This was seen in the case of 'Lucente v. IBM, 310 F.3d 243, 258 (2d Cir. 2002)', where the aggrieved party could not claim for breach of contract if he could not prove any damages.\n\nPlease note, while this list provides an overview of the elements required to establish a breach of contract claim under New York law, specific legal advice related to a particular situation should be obtained from a licensed attorney.", "reference_answers": ["a material breach, where the contract did not specify a deadline and the plans were completed within a reasonable time period.On the other hand, where a contract states that time is of the essence, a failure to meet a specified deadline constitutes a material breach.

In that endeavor, the law permits the recovery of both \"direct damages\" and \"consequential damages\".Direct damages are those that flow naturally and probably from a breach of contract. For example, where the seller delivers imperfect goods, the buyer's direct damages are the difference between the value of the defective goods and their value if they had been perfect. Or if the buyer doesn't make payment, the seller's direct damages are the money he was owed.Consequential damages include whatever was within the contemplation of the parties when they entered the contract. Thus, consequential damages includes lost profits, damage to the good will of the plaintiff, and special or incidental losses (such as the cost of correcting a defective good, or of transporting the defective goods back to the seller.)But a plaintiff may not recover any damages which are speculative or indefinite. To surmount this problem, plaintiffs in substantial lawsuits will sometimes hire an expert witness, such as someone with an MBA, to opine on the degree of damages.

Ye is officially branded a traitor and is forced to join a labor brigade in Inner Mongolia, where she befriends a government journalist who enlists Ye's help in transcribing a letter to the government. The letter details policy suggestions based on the Western book Silent Spring, which Ye read. To save himself, the journalist betrays Ye, who is sentenced to prison after the letter is viewed as seditious by the government. In prison, Ye is recruited by Yang Weining and Lei Zhicheng, two military physicists working under Red Coast, a secret Chinese initiative to use high-powered radio waves to damage spy satellites. \nAfter working with them for some time, she learns that the stated purpose is a front for Red Coast's true intention: the search for extraterrestrial life.

It's actually a cover of the original by Indochine, which was an iconic track back in the early 80s in France. The term \"3SEX\" is a play on words, in French, it can sound like \"très sec\" which translates to \"very dry,\" but it’s also referencing the term 'trois' meaning three, hence it could be seen as exploring the concept of a threesome or trisexual experiences.\n\nThe song explores themes of lust, love, and desire, discussing the paradoxical nature of intimate relationships. It presents the idea of loving someone so intensely that you almost despise them, a concept that's related to the 'love/hate' relationship many have come across within certain romantic engagements.\n\nWhile the original song was composed in the context of the 1980s, a time when conversations about sexuality were still relatively taboo, this modern cover brings a contemporary feel to the timeless themes. The unique collaboration also brings two generations of French music together, making it a special project that depicts an intersection of past and modern expressions of identity, sexuality, and human relationships. \n\nHowever, interpretations of songs like these can vary greatly depending on the listener as music is art and can be very subjective.", "reference_answers": [], "evidence": [], "label": null}

They breathe by way of buccal pumping, actively “inhaling” water by using cheek muscles to draw it into the mouth and over the gills. This allows sharks to stop moving but continue breathing. They can rest on the ocean floor without worry and can even partially bury themselves in the sand, using respiratory openings behind the eyes, called spiracles, to pull water through their gills when their mouths are covered.But some shark species don’t have the luxury of buccal pumping. For example, the great white shark, the whale shark, and the mako shark don’t have buccal muscles at all.

Some observers have noted that the taller of the two major-party candidates tends to prevail, and argue this is due to the public's preference for taller candidates.[1]\nThe tallest U.S. president was Abraham Lincoln at 6 feet 4 inches (193 centimeters), while the shortest was James Madison at 5 feet 4 inches (163 centimeters).\nJoe Biden, the current president, is 6 feet 0 inches (183 centimeters) according to a physical examination summary from February 2023.[2]\nFolk wisdom about U.S. presidential politics holds that the taller of the two major-party candidates always wins or almost always wins since the advent of the televised presidential debate.[15]\nThere are more data if the relationship of electoral success to height difference starts from the year 1900, rather than from the beginning of televised debates. In the thirty-one presidential elections between 1900 and 2020, twenty-one of the winning candidates have been taller than their opponents, while nine have been shorter, and one was the same height. On average the winner was 1.20 inches (3.0 cm) taller than the loser.[43]\nHowever, it may be argued that drawing the line at any date ignores the fact that pictorial depictions of presidential hopefuls have been available to the American public at large well before debates were televised. Stereographs were widely used as a form of photojournalism for historical events (including political events) by the 1870s.[44] Cutting off the date at 1900 excludes the seven presidential elections immediately preceding where the taller candidate won only once (which, when included, partially equalizes the ratio to 22 taller vs. 14 shorter winners between 1872 and 2020). Considering that political cartoons and text-based descriptions of candidates have been a staple of American politics since the beginning, one could argue that Americans have always been able to compare candidates by height. Thus, upon including all elections until 2020 where the heights of each candidate are known, the average height of the winner above the loser drops to a mere 0.39 inches (1.0 cm);[45] this average height difference becomes little more than a round-off error—a mere 0.21 inches (0.5 cm)—when excluding the 2016 election, in which gender not only accounted for the height difference, but was likely the greater physical distinction between the two main candidates than height.[45]\nThe claims about taller candidates winning almost all modern presidential elections is still pervasive, however.

Stereographs were widely used as a form of photojournalism for historical events (including political events) by the 1870s.[44] Cutting off the date at 1900 excludes the seven presidential elections immediately preceding where the taller candidate won only once (which, when included, partially equalizes the ratio to 22 taller vs. 14 shorter winners between 1872 and 2020). Considering that political cartoons and text-based descriptions of candidates have been a staple of American politics since the beginning, one could argue that Americans have always been able to compare candidates by height. Thus, upon including all elections until 2020 where the heights of each candidate are known, the average height of the winner above the loser drops to a mere 0.39 inches (1.0 cm);[45] this average height difference becomes little more than a round-off error—a mere 0.21 inches (0.5 cm)—when excluding the 2016 election, in which gender not only accounted for the height difference, but was likely the greater physical distinction between the two main candidates than height.[45]\nThe claims about taller candidates winning almost all modern presidential elections is still pervasive, however. Examples of such views include:\nA comparison of the heights of the winning presidential candidate with the losing candidate from each election since 1788 is provided below to evaluate such views.\nNotes:\n** Lost the House of Representatives vote, but received the most popular votes and a plurality of electoral votes; however, not the majority needed to win.\n† Ran unopposed\nThe tallest president elected to office was Abraham Lincoln (6 ft 3+3⁄4 in or 192.4 cm).

For instance, Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte is often portrayed as short because British cartoons of the time mocked him this way. In actuality, he was of average height. This stereotype, however, stuck and was later misattributed to his uncle, Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nAnother way this misrepresentation happened is through portraits of the two men, which were often idealized or exaggerated for political reasons. For example, Napoleon III had a lavish style and was often depicted in grand imperial clothing, which was a part of his public persona as he attempted to link himself with the legacy of his famous uncle. Those state portraits of Napoleon III wearing opulent attire and an elaborate mustache became emblematic of the Napoleonic era, and often influenced the popular depictions of Napoleon Bonaparte.\n\nIt's important to note that Napoleon Bonaparte was also often idealized and mythologized during his lifetime and after his death, which also influenced his popular image. Combining these factors, the perception of these two distinct individuals became somewhat meshed in popular culture, with Napoleon III's caricature attributes becoming stereotypes for Napoleon Bonaparte. This makes the image of Napoleon we have today a blend of his own legacy as well as his nephew's.", "reference_answers": ["Something went wrong.

{"id": 61, "question": "Can you tell me about the history of the Great Wall of China?", "prompt": "Can you tell me about the history of the Great Wall of China?", "response": "Absolutely, the Great Wall of China is a remarkable monument that holds immense historic and cultural significance.\n\nThe origins of the Wall can be traced back to the 7th century BC when ancient Chinese states built separate walls to fend off invasions from nomadic tribes in the North. However, the wall we commonly refer to as the \"Great Wall\" began to take shape under the rule of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of unified China in the 3rd century BC. He ordered the linking of the separate walls and further extensions to prevent invasions from the Huns.\n\nThe Great Wall underwent several renovations and enhancements over the centuries especially during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), which is the wall mostly seen today.

A motorized pump moves hydraulic fluid in and out of the chambers, and that fluid causes the membrane to move; blood flows through the other side of each membrane. The blood-facing side of the membrane is made of tissue obtained from a sac that surrounds a cow's heart, to make the device more biocompatible. The Carmat device also uses valves made from cow heart tissue and has sensors to detect increased pressure within the device. That information is sent to an internal control system that can adjust the flow rate in response to increased demand, such as when a patient is exercising.[36] This distinguishes it from previous designs that maintain a constant flow rate.[citation needed]\nThe Carmat device, unlike previous designs, is meant to be used in cases of terminal heart failure, instead of being used as a bridge device while the patient awaits a transplant.[37] At 900 grams it weighs nearly three times the typical heart and is targeted primarily towards obese men. It also requires the patient to carry around an additional Li-Ion battery. The projected lifetime of the artificial heart is around 5 years (230 million beats).[38]\nIn 2016, trials for the Carmat \"fully artificial heart\" were banned by the National Agency for Security and Medicine in Europe after short survival rates were confirmed. The ban was lifted in May 2017. At that time, a European report stated that Celyad's C-Cure cell therapy for ischemic heart failure[39] \"could only help a subpopulation of Phase III study participants, and Carmat will hope that its artificial heart will be able to treat a higher proportion of heart failure patients\".[40]\nThe Carmat artificial heart was approved for sale in the European Union, receiving a CE marking on December 22, 2020.[41] Its stock price increased over a third upon the announcement of the news.[42]\nThe U.S. Army artificial heart pump was a compact, air-powered unit developed by Kenneth Woodward at Harry Diamond Laboratories in the early to mid-1960s.[43][44] The Army's heart pump was partially made of plexiglass, and consisted of two valves, a chamber, and a suction flapper.[43] The pump operated without any moving parts under the principle of fluid amplification – providing a pulsating air pressure source resembling a heartbeat.[44]\nSince 1991, the Foundation for Cardiac Surgery Development (FRK) in Zabrze, Poland, has been working on developing an artificial heart.

At that time, a European report stated that Celyad's C-Cure cell therapy for ischemic heart failure[39] \"could only help a subpopulation of Phase III study participants, and Carmat will hope that its artificial heart will be able to treat a higher proportion of heart failure patients\".[40]\nThe Carmat artificial heart was approved for sale in the European Union, receiving a CE marking on December 22, 2020.[41] Its stock price increased over a third upon the announcement of the news.[42]\nThe U.S. Army artificial heart pump was a compact, air-powered unit developed by Kenneth Woodward at Harry Diamond Laboratories in the early to mid-1960s.[43][44] The Army's heart pump was partially made of plexiglass, and consisted of two valves, a chamber, and a suction flapper.[43] The pump operated without any moving parts under the principle of fluid amplification – providing a pulsating air pressure source resembling a heartbeat.[44]\nSince 1991, the Foundation for Cardiac Surgery Development (FRK) in Zabrze, Poland, has been working on developing an artificial heart. Nowadays,[when?] the Polish system for heart support POLCAS consists of the artificial ventricle POLVAD-MEV and the three controllers POLPDU-401, POLPDU-402 and POLPDU-501. Presented devices are designed to handle only one patient. The control units of the 401 and 402 series may be used only in hospital due to its big size, method of control and type of power supply.

That same year, that National Science Foundation awarded her a grant of $25,000 payable over two years for \"instructional equipment for undergraduate education.\"[17] One of the first computer science departments at a small college, Keller directed this department for twenty years.[18][19] Clarke College now has the Keller Computer Center and Information Services, which is named after her and which provides computing and telecommunication support to Clarke College students, faculty members, and staff.[20] The college has also established the Mary Kenneth Keller Computer Science Scholarship in her honor.[21]\nKeller was an advocate for the involvement of women in computing[5] and the use of computers for education. She helped to establish the Association of Small Computer Users in Education (ASCUE).[22] She went on to write four books in the field.[23] At the ACM/SIGUCC User Services Conference in 1975, Keller declared \"we have not fully used a computer as the greatest interdisciplinary tool that has been invented to date.\"[24]\nKeller died on January 10, 1985, at the age of 71.[22]\n"], "evidence": ["Mary Kenneth Keller, B.V.M.

Tang were the first two recipients of computer science doctorates (Keller's Ph.D. and Tang's D.Sc. were awarded on the same day).[1][2][3][4]\nKeller was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on December 17, 1913, to John Adam Keller and Catherine Josephine (née Sullivan) Keller.[3] She entered the Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in 1932[5][6] and took her vows with that religious congregation in 1940.[5][7]  She completed both her B.S. (Bachelor of Science) in Mathematics in 1943 and her M.S. (Master of Science) in Mathematics and Physics in 1953 from DePaul University in Chicago. Keller earned her Ph.D. (Doctor of Philosophy) from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1965.[8][9][10] Her dissertation, Inductive Inference on Computer Generated Patterns,[10] focused on \"constructing algorithms that performed analytic differentiation on algebraic expression, written in CDC FORTRAN 63.\"[11]\nThroughout Keller's graduate studies, she was affiliated with various institutions including the University of Michigan, Purdue, and Dartmouth.[12] Many sources claim that Keller began working at the National Science Foundation[13] workshop in 1958 in the computer science center at Dartmouth College, a male-only institution at the time, where she participated in the implementation of the first DTSS BASIC kernel for the language, working under John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz along with about a dozen other students. But this cannot be correct since Dartmouth did not acquire its first computer until 1959.[14] Keller in fact was at Dartmouth sometime in 1961[15] when Dartmouth ALGOL 30 was being developed and used in undergraduate education.\nKeller believed in the potential for computers to increase access to information and promote education.[16] After finishing her doctorate in 1965, Keller founded the computer science department at Clarke College (now Clarke University), a Catholic women's college founded by Sisters of Charity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dubuque, Iowa. That same year, that National Science Foundation awarded her a grant of $25,000 payable over two years for \"instructional equipment for undergraduate education.\"[17] One of the first computer science departments at a small college, Keller directed this department for twenty years.[18][19] Clarke College now has the Keller Computer Center and Information Services, which is named after her and which provides computing and telecommunication support to Clarke College students, faculty members, and staff.[20] The college has also established the Mary Kenneth Keller Computer Science Scholarship in her honor.[21]\nKeller was an advocate for the involvement of women in computing[5] and the use of computers for education. She helped to establish the Association of Small Computer Users in Education (ASCUE).[22] She went on to write four books in the field.[23] At the ACM/SIGUCC User Services Conference in 1975, Keller declared \"we have not fully used a computer as the greatest interdisciplinary tool that has been invented to date.\"[24]\nKeller died on January 10, 1985, at the age of 71.[22]\n"], "label": null}

Some goods have become much more affordable since 1960 due to advances in technology and production efficiency, such as technology-based products. Computers, TVs, and other electronics are not just cheaper but also more powerful than their counterparts in the 1960s. \n\nOn the other hand, some everyday goods such as housing, education, and healthcare have outpaced wage growth and inflation, effectively making them less affordable for the average American. For example, compared to 1960, today's average American spends a larger percentage of their income on housing and healthcare. \n\nIn general, affordability isn't solely about the price of goods or services, but also about income and wealth. While the average nominal income has risen since 1960, the distribution of those income gains differ significantly across the income spectrum, meaning not all Americans have experienced the same changes in affordability.\n\nTherefore, the answer will be different based on the type of goods we're talking about and the specific income group. However, it's fair to say that while some goods have become more affordable, others have not, particularly when considering factors such as stagnant wage growth for many American households.", "reference_answers": ["Related StoriesToday, everything from movie tickets to college tuition is  more expensive, and not simply because of inflation.

Honeybees count landmarks when navigating toward sources of nectar. Lionesses tally the number of roars they hear from an intruding pride before deciding whether to attack or retreat. Some ants keep track of their steps; some spiders keep track of how many prey are caught in their web. One species of frog bases its entire mating ritual on number: If a male calls out — a whining pew followed by a brief pulsing note called a chuck — his rival responds by placing two chucks at the end of his own call. The first frog then responds with three, the other with four, and so on up to around six, when they run out of breath.Practically every animal that scientists have studied — insects and cephalopods, amphibians and reptiles, birds and mammals — can distinguish between different numbers of objects in a set or sounds in a sequence. They don’t just have a sense of “greater than” or “less than,” but an approximate sense of quantity: that two is distinct from three, that 15 is distinct from 20. This mental representation of set size, called numerosity, seems to be “a general ability,” and an ancient one, said Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento in Italy.Now, researchers are uncovering increasingly more complex numerical abilities in their animal subjects. Many species have displayed a capacity for abstraction that extends to performing simple arithmetic, while a select few have even demonstrated a grasp of the quantitative concept of “zero” — an idea so paradoxical that very young children sometimes struggle with it. In fact, experiments have shown that both monkeys and honeybees know how to treat zero as a numerosity, placing it on a mental number line much as they would numerosity one or two.

RyanThe fact that those three species are from diverse taxonomic groups — primates, insects and birds — suggests that certain numerical abilities have evolved over and over again throughout the animal kingdom. Scientists are puzzling over why nature has gifted so many animals with at least a rudimentary knack for numbers, and what if anything that might tell us about the deep origins of human mathematics. There are still more questions than answers, but neuroscientists and other experts have learned enough to amend and broaden perspectives on animal cognition.

Some ants keep track of their steps; some spiders keep track of how many prey are caught in their web. One species of frog bases its entire mating ritual on number: If a male calls out — a whining pew followed by a brief pulsing note called a chuck — his rival responds by placing two chucks at the end of his own call. The first frog then responds with three, the other with four, and so on up to around six, when they run out of breath.Practically every animal that scientists have studied — insects and cephalopods, amphibians and reptiles, birds and mammals — can distinguish between different numbers of objects in a set or sounds in a sequence. They don’t just have a sense of “greater than” or “less than,” but an approximate sense of quantity: that two is distinct from three, that 15 is distinct from 20. This mental representation of set size, called numerosity, seems to be “a general ability,” and an ancient one, said Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento in Italy.Now, researchers are uncovering increasingly more complex numerical abilities in their animal subjects. Many species have displayed a capacity for abstraction that extends to performing simple arithmetic, while a select few have even demonstrated a grasp of the quantitative concept of “zero” — an idea so paradoxical that very young children sometimes struggle with it. In fact, experiments have shown that both monkeys and honeybees know how to treat zero as a numerosity, placing it on a mental number line much as they would numerosity one or two. And in a paper published in the Journal of Neuroscience in June, researchers reported that crows can do it, too.Get Quanta Magazine delivered to your inboxIn mating competitions, male túngara frogs take turns adding one sound to their calls.Michael J. RyanThe fact that those three species are from diverse taxonomic groups — primates, insects and birds — suggests that certain numerical abilities have evolved over and over again throughout the animal kingdom. Scientists are puzzling over why nature has gifted so many animals with at least a rudimentary knack for numbers, and what if anything that might tell us about the deep origins of human mathematics. There are still more questions than answers, but neuroscientists and other experts have learned enough to amend and broaden perspectives on animal cognition.

It's important to note that some films originally banned have later been unbanned, usually after edits, and sometimes the ban has been lifted without any changes to the film.\n\n1. \"Love Camp 7\" (1969): This exploitation film set in a Nazi concentration camp was banned due to its violent and sexual content. The ban was upheld as of the last review in 2020.\n\n2. \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (1974): Initially banned due to its violent content, it was later granted an 18 certificate in its uncut form.\n\n3. \"The Last House on the Left\" (1972): Wes Craven's debut film was banned for many years due to its brutal violence and rape scenes. It was eventually released on DVD fully uncut in 2008.\n\n4. \"The Evil Dead\" (1981): This horror film was originally banned as a 'video nasty' in the 80s. It was later released after a few scenes were cut, and has since been released uncut.\n\n5. \"Cannibal Holocaust\" (1980): Due to extreme violence and scenes of animal cruelty, the film was banned in several countries including the UK. An edited version has since been released.\n\n6. \"Mikey\" (1992): A film about a violent child was banned because it was released close to the James Bulger murder case, and it was feared it could incite further violence. The ban is still in place as of 2022.\n\n7. \"SS Experiment Love Camp\" (1976): Another movie involving Nazi concentration camps and sexual exploitation, this movie remains banned by the BBFC. \n\nPlease note that the censorship standards and what is considered acceptable or unacceptable change over time, so a film that is banned today might not be tomorrow, and vice versa.

Research indicates that early childhood education, which includes kindergarten, can have significant benefits on a child’s cognitive development, social and emotional development, as well as long-term educational achievement.\n\n1. Cognitive Development: The early years of a child’s life are critical for cognitive development, a time when the brain is rapidly developing. Kindergarten provides structured learning experiences that challenge and stimulate a child's cognitive abilities.\n\n2. Social and Emotional Development: Attendance in kindergarten also helps children develop social and emotional skills. In kindergarten, children learn how to cooperate, share, take turns, and interact with peers and adults in a structured environment.\n\n3. Long-Term Educational Achievement: Some studies (such as the Perry Preschool Project and the Abecedarian Project) suggest that children who attend kindergarten or pre-school programs are more likely to have higher academic achievement, better job prospects, higher income, and lower rates of criminal behavior in adulthood.\n\nWhile the exact value of kindergarten might depend on the quality of the program, the consensus seems to be that it does play a role in early childhood development. However, each child is unique, and their development may be influenced by a range of factors, such as home environment, individual characteristics, and early intervention services.", "reference_answers": [], "evidence": [], "label": null}

This episode was directed and narrated by Orson Welles, inspired by the H. G. Wells' novel \"The War of the Worlds\" published in 1898.\n\nThe script was written as a series of simulated news bulletins, which suggested an actual alien invasion by Martians was currently in progress, causing significant public confusion and panic among some listeners who had tuned in and misconstrued the fiction for reality, believing that the Earth was being invaded by Martians. Assigning the locations as real places within the United States also contributed to the realism.\n\nThough this event is often held as an example of mass hysteria, the scale of the panic was likely not as widespread as later reported. Many listeners understood the program to be a radio drama, but those who didn't -- either tuning in part-way or misunderstanding the introduction -- truly believed an invasion was happening, prompting calls to police and news agencies.\n\nThe impact of this broadcast led to significant discussion and reconsideration of regulations about what could be presented in broadcasts in order to avoid similar confusions in the future.", "reference_answers": ["Mars.

One set, the dorsal ribs, are found in the dividing septum between the upper and lower parts of the main muscle segments, projecting roughly sideways from the vertebral column. The second set, the ventral ribs arise from the vertebral column just below the dorsal ribs, and enclose the lower body, often joining at the tips. Not all species possess both types of rib, with the dorsal ribs being most commonly absent. Sharks, for example, have no dorsal ribs, and only very short ventral ribs. In some teleosts, there may be additional rib-like bones within the muscle mass.[9]\nTetrapods, however, only ever have a single set of ribs which are probably homologous with the dorsal ribs of fishes.

One set, the dorsal ribs, are found in the dividing septum between the upper and lower parts of the main muscle segments, projecting roughly sideways from the vertebral column. The second set, the ventral ribs arise from the vertebral column just below the dorsal ribs, and enclose the lower body, often joining at the tips. Not all species possess both types of rib, with the dorsal ribs being most commonly absent. Sharks, for example, have no dorsal ribs, and only very short ventral ribs.

According to a study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, average weekly hours worked by Americans have somewhat decreased since the early 20th century. However, it's important to note that these trends can vary widely by industry, occupation, and socio-economic circumstances, and certain groups, such as salaried workers, often report longer work weeks. \n\nIn recent years, the discussion about work-life balance has gained momentum, with a spotlight on the rise of \"work from home\" and flexible hours. This can sometimes blur the line between work and leisure time, making it feel like people are working more, even if the official \"clocked in\" hours aren't significantly higher.\n\nAs of now, there's no definitive answer that applies to every working American as people's experiences and work patterns can vary dramatically.

The play features the famous United Airlines Flight 232 that crash-landed in a cornfield near Sioux City, Iowa, after suffering a catastrophic failure of one engine and most flight controls.\nSurvivor, a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, is about a cult member who dictates his life story to a flight recorder before the plane runs out of fuel and crashes.\n Media related to Flight data recorders at Wikimedia Commons\n This article incorporates public domain material from websites or documents of the National Transportation Safety Board.\n"], "label": null}

{"id": 183, "question": "What was the 'New Populism'?", "prompt": "What was the 'New Populism'?", "response": "The 'New Populism' is a term used to refer to a political philosophy that emerged in more recent years, advocating for the rights and power of the common people in their struggle against the privileged elite. This resurgence of populism, often seen in both left-wing and right-wing political movements, has been noted worldwide.\n\nKey themes of the 'New Populism' include a critique of established political elites and institutions, the desire for greater sovereignty and a return to 'the people's rule', the advocacy for social equality, and often, a focus on nationalist principles.\n\nThis term gained significant traction in the wake of the 2008 global economic crisis, where populistic ideas began rising due to dissatisfaction with economic disparities and political representation. Though its methods and goals can vary significantly depending on the region or country, new populism remains a powerful force in global politics.\n  \nPlease note that the term 'New Populism' like all political terms can have nuanced differences in meaning depending on geographical and cultural context.\n", "reference_answers": ["From Anti-Pluralism by William A.
