# üõ∏ UFO: A Unified Framework for Factuality Evaluation with Multiple Plug-and-Play Fact Sources

Submission to EMNLP 2025 (System Demonstration Track)

UFO is a unified and extensible framework designed for evaluating the factuality of LLM outputs, leveraging multiple plug-and-play fact sources including human-written evidence, web search results, and LLM knowledge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure the System
Update the following values in `config.yaml`:
- `openai_apikey`
- `openai_baseurl`
- `openai_model`

You can use either online LLM inference services or local backends:
- `Online Services`: [OpenAI](https://openai.com) and Siliconflow [Siliconflow](https://www.siliconflow.cn)
- `Local Backend` (via vLLM): 
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 nohup vllm serve <model_name> --dtype auto --api-key EMPTY --port 2233 --tensor-parallel-size 1 > qwen2.5-14b.log 2>&1 &
```
‚úÖ Default model: `Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct`


## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Overview

## üöÄ Run Evaluation with UFO
Run the evaluation pipeline:
```bash
bash run_exp.sh
```

#TODO
### Usage
Please set the default settings in `config.yaml`, including:
1. output settings: `save_dir` and `dataset_name`.
2. inference setting: `openai_apikey`, `openai_baseurl`, and `openai_model`.
3. fact source setting: set the config in `config.yaml`



To directly use:
```
bash run_exp.sh
```
Please set the value of DATASET_NAME, SUB_NAME, OPENAI_APIKEY, OPENAI_BASEURL, and OPENAI_MODEL.



## üåê Interactive Web Demo
Launch the interactive demo interface:
```shell
python app.py
```
Access the web UI in your browser and evaluate using `example_data_upload.jsonl`, or any JSONL files with each line containing two keys: `response` for the evaluated LLM text, and `reference_answers` for any relevant reference (optional).
